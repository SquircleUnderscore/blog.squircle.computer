Hi! My name is [Squircle](https://squircle.computer/) (not my real name, btw). You can use **he/him** pronouns, but honestly, use whatever you likeâ€”it doesn't matter much to me!  

Born in France, English is not my first language, but this blog helps me improve. (I hope it's still easy to read for you!)  

## Find me around the net  

* [Website](https://squircle.computer/)  
* [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/squircle.computer)  
* [Discord](https://discord.com/users/871735378837667880)  

### Special Thanks  

* [Strawberry Starter](https://strawberrystarter.neocities.org/)  
    * Without this project, none of this would have been possible! If you want to create a blog quickly, I highly recommend it. If IDEs feel too complicated, [Bearblog](https://bearblog.dev/) is a great alternative.  
* [Bluesky-comments-tag](https://github.com/ascorbic/bluesky-comments-tag)  
    * I wanted a comment section without using Disqus. This project makes it possible to integrate Bluesky comments without adding extra packages.  

`Thanks for reading! <3`
