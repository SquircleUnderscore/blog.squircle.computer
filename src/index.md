I created this to share my discoveries in a more concise and "professional" way than my main [website](https://squircle.computer/)... which, let's be honest, is pretty chaotic! ðŸ˜†  

Lots of posts are coming, so feel free to add me to your [favorite RSS reader](https://blog.squircle.computer/feed.xml) or get a small [email update once a month](https://forms.gle/GPB3bhQwVBGDMyrg7).  

> All my articles are written in French and then translated by me into weird English before being corrected by an AI.
